Things i want to add
    1- first of all i want to link the pages together.
    2- I would like to put the account settings where people can manage thier accounts.
    3- I would like to add an image for the users.
    4- Yup, these are the important things so far.


As for the teamSpace page the features i want to add:
    * Ok as far as for the teams space page i want to add something else.
    in each component I want to add a dropdown menu at the top and then this drop down menu should have a list of options to 
    organize the given tasks, notes, or issues. the filters could be completedTasks, organize by priority, date, and stuff. and same goes for issues.
    resolved issues , and organize according to date and stuff.

And then As for the Docs page:
    The feautre i Want is that to render the docs as HTML and then you have the ability to edit them, and then i want like the ability to create a sideBar
    for the docs to be more clear and stuff.

As for authenctication and authorization: 
    I want to create a button like the clerk button which is a button that has you avatar and then when you click it it gives you the ability to logout or 
    manage your account and shows some of the account info. 

as for the dashboard: 
     If you are the one that created the account you should have a page where you can see the user activity of the team and add admins with permissions to 
     the team and you can delete or ban users.


     Ok let's start with the docs:
     ok so so far my idea is that in the page only certain can people can have access to update the docs and these people are granted access by the project 
     creator.
     users should have the ability to
     1-create a sidebar option.
     2-inside this side bar can have the ability to add titles and nested titles, bullet points and lists.
     3-
